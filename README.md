# AyurPlantNet: Ayurvedic Plant Species Classification

This repository contains the implementation of the models described in the 2023 research paper titled **"AyurPlantNet: An Unbiased Lightweight Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Ayurvedic Plant Species Classification."** The goal of this project is to accurately classify Ayurvedic plant species using a lightweight deep convolutional neural network architecture.

## Overview

The AyurPlantNet model is designed to identify and classify various Ayurvedic plant species from images. The research paper introduced a novel architecture that balances accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for deployment in environments with limited resources.

## Implementation Details

This repository includes the following:

- **Model Architecture:** Implementation of the AyurPlantNet model, including all layers and configurations as described in the paper.
- **Training Scripts:** Scripts used to train the model on the provided dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Code to evaluate the performance of the model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Results:** The results obtained from training and testing the models, including comparisons with the baseline and other models mentioned in the paper.

## Key Features

- **Lightweight Design:** The model is optimized for resource-constrained environments without sacrificing performance.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved higher accuracy than reported in the original research paper, demonstrating the effectiveness of the implemented techniques.
- **Reproducible Results:** All code and datasets used are provided to ensure the results can be reproduced by others.
